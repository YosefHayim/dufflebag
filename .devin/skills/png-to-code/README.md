# png-to-code

Convert a PNG design into pixel-perfect code — SVG, HTML/CSS, Tailwind, or React — using a measured screenshot-diff loop.

## Setup

From this directory's `scripts/` folder:

```bash
cd scripts
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm run typecheck
```

Run scripts from `scripts/` with `npx tsx src/...` or the npm shortcuts below.

## Core harness

| Script | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| pixel-diff | `npm run diff -- --target design.png --input build.html` | Render + diff → ratio + hotspots |
| inspect-png | `npm run inspect -- --input design.png --at 40,120` | Dimensions, color samples, palette |
| frames | `npm run frames -- page.html sheet.png 300 0,300,600` | Animation contact sheet |

## PNG utilities (`src/png/`)

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `mask.ts` | Mask regions on a PNG before tracing |
| `crop.ts` | Crop + upscale a bbox for inspection |
| `regions.ts` | Column-projection band detection |
| `detectPurple.ts` | Connected-component violet feature detection |
| `extractBlob.ts` | Trace soft background blobs to SVG paths |

## HTML / SVG utilities

| Script | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| wrap | `src/html/wrap.ts` | Wrap SVG in sized HTML for diffing |
| embed-svg | `src/html/embedSvg.ts` | Build a responsive HTML viewer around an SVG |
| hand-clip | `src/png/handClip.ts` | Flood-fill hand silhouette for clip-path |

## Verification (`src/verify/`)

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `stitch.ts` | Side-by-side PNG compare sheet |
| `renderShot.ts` | Quick Playwright screenshot of HTML |

## Canonical iteration

Use this shape for any PNG → SVG/HTML task. The file names are examples; replace them with the user's real target and build output.

```bash
npm run inspect -- --input design.png
npm run diff -- --target design.png --input build/index.html --out diff.png
```

Read the ratio and top hotspot, then make exactly one edit. When the hotspot is hard to interpret, ask a second agent or browser model to act only as a visual judge:

```bash
bridge ask "Compare design.png, current.png, and diff.png. List the exact visual changes needed next; do not rewrite code." --provider chatgpt --attach design.png current.png diff.png --json
```

Use `bridge --help` / `bridge ask --help` for the installed attachment syntax. Feed the judge the target, current screenshot, and diff image. The judge's answer is feedback, not a pass condition; re-run `npm run diff` after every edit.

Example loop:

```text
before: ratio 0.1842; hotspot top-left; judge says header is too low
edit: move header up 14px
after:  ratio 0.1217; next hotspot is the icon

before: ratio 0.1217; judge says icon is too small
edit: scale icon to the measured bbox
after:  ratio 0.0086; next hotspot is button shadow

before: ratio 0.0086; judge says shadow is too soft
edit: reduce blur
after:  ratio 0.0008; measured pass
```

## Local case-study scripts (`src/examples/robot/`)

The repository still includes local-only exploratory scripts from an animated illustration case study. They are useful as implementation references, but their binary assets are not shipped, so do not use them as the canonical example for future work.

Use `scripts/robot.svgo.config.mjs` only for that case-study style of animated SVG where IDs and opacity-zero rest frames must be preserved.

## SVGO

```bash
npx svgo --config scripts/svgo.config.mjs -i in.svg -o out.svg
```

## Output stack

Match the target repo's framework when one exists. Otherwise default to vanilla HTML + CSS + inline SVG. See `SKILL.md` stack detection.
