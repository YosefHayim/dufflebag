# dufflebag — Purpose & Direction

What an agent reads to understand product intent before changing behavior. The
human-facing introduction lives in `README.md`; runtime boundaries live in
`CONTEXT.md`; approved names live in `LANGUAGE.md`; coding rules live in
`CODE-STYLE.md`.

## The problem

Coding-agent workflows accumulate the same recurring friction across repositories:
long sessions exhaust their usable context, agents duplicate existing code, local
skills and hooks drift between tools, and every repository rebuilds the same CI and
publishing setup. Dufflebag packages one owned set of guardrails, skills, agent
configuration, and workflow templates behind a surgical installer.

## Who it is for

Dufflebag serves its owner first and other coding-agent users who deliberately want
this exact bag. It is not a plugin marketplace, a hosted agent platform, or a team
service with compatibility guarantees.

## Product promise

A user can install, update, diagnose, configure, and remove the bag without losing
unowned bytes. Catalog entries declare what may ship; receipts declare what may be
removed. Installed hooks run without package dependencies and fail open so a guard
cannot block the editor because its own execution failed.

## Goals

- Install or update a selected feature set in global or project scope.
- Restore prior bytes during receipt-authorized uninstallation.
- Warn and wind down long sessions before they exhaust context.
- Detect structurally duplicated TypeScript while edits are being made and in CI.
- Narrate complete agent replies locally and support local dictation/refinement.
- Turn PNG references into code through a measured screenshot-difference loop.
- Scaffold owned CI and publishing workflows into another repository.
- Keep every supported agent format catalog-driven and evidence-backed.

## Non-goals

- Hosting or discovering third-party extensions.
- Preserving old command forms by default before version 1.0.
- Adding runtime package dependencies to installed TypeScript hooks.
- Guessing unsupported agent lifecycle integrations.
- Hosting workflow execution after templates are copied.
- Building abstractions for hypothetical future consumers.

## Direction

The current product owns installation lifecycle, managed configuration, diagnostics,
feature and agent catalogs, dependency-free hook islands, copied skills, local voice,
and CI/publishing workflow scaffolding. Near-term work strengthens verified agent
adapters, makes the command surface predictable for both people and automation, and
keeps the authored bag consistent through one enforceable code-style contract.

Additional template kinds or agent integrations are considered only when an actual
repository or verified tool contract needs them.

## Guiding principles

- One source of truth for each fact.
- Business policy separated from mutable mechanisms by reason to change.
- Honest domain names instead of generic placeholders.
- Schema-owned runtime and persisted contracts.
- Catalog-authorized shipping and receipt-authorized removal.
- Dependency-free, fail-open installed hooks.
- Clean breaks over compatibility layers unless migration is explicitly required.
- Tests provide the courage to change structure without preserving accidental design.
