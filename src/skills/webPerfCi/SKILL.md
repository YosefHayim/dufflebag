description: Wires automated website-performance gates into CI/CD and enforces Core Web Vitals budgets (LCP, INP, CLS). Sets up a Lighthouse CI budget check on every PR (lab), a Chrome UX Report (CrUX) real-user field check after deploy, and an optional web-vitals RUM snippet. Grills the repo to detect the stack and how the site runs (static build, dev server, or preview URL), then writes lighthouserc, the GitHub Actions workflows, and zero-dep CrUX + PSI checkers. Use when the user wants to add performance testing, Lighthouse, Lighthouse CI, PageSpeed Insights, Core Web Vitals, web-vitals, a performance budget, or a speed/perf gate to a website's CI/CD, or mentions LCP/INP/CLS regressions or a slow site.

# Web Performance CI (Core Web Vitals)

Put a **measured performance budget** between a change and production. Three gates, each watching a different truth:

| Layer | Tool | Answers | Runs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Lab** | Lighthouse CI (`lhci autorun`) | "Did this PR regress in a controlled test?" | every PR |
| **Field** | Chrome UX Report (CrUX) API | "What do real users actually experience?" | after deploy / weekly |
| **RUM** | `web-vitals` (optional) | "Which element/script caused it, per page?" | in the live app |

The budget numbers are the same everywhere (one SSOT): **LCP ≤ 2.5s · INP ≤ 200ms · CLS ≤ 0.1**, plus FCP ≤ 1.8s, TTFB ≤ 0.8s, Lighthouse performance ≥ 0.90. **Field data comes from the Chrome UX Report (CrUX) API** — Google is retiring CrUX data from PageSpeed Insights, so `runCrux.mjs` reads CrUX directly while PSI stays the lab source. New here? read `TECH-GLOSSARY.md` first; the model is in `CONTEXT.md`.

## Ground rule

**INP is a field-only metric** — it needs a real user interacting, so Lighthouse's lab run can't produce it. In the lab gate we assert **Total Blocking Time (TBT)** as INP's proxy; the true INP comes from the field (PSI/CrUX) and your RUM. Never claim an INP number from a lab run.

## Front door — grill first, then wire (via grill-me)

Interview the user one question at a time; **recommend an answer for each**, and if the repo already answers it, explore the repo instead of asking. Walk the tree in order — each answer changes what you write:

1. **Which surfaces do we gate?** → recommend the homepage + the two highest-traffic templates (a listing + a detail page), not every route.
2. **How does the site run for a test?** (`staticDistDir` a built folder · `startServerCommand` a dev server · a deployed **preview URL**) → **auto-detect** from `package.json` + host: Astro/Vite/Next static export → `staticDistDir`; an app server → `startServerCommand`; Cloudflare Pages/Vercel PR previews → preview URL.
3. **Enforce or observe first?** → recommend shipping assertions as `warn` for ~1–2 weeks to learn the baseline, then flip the Core Web Vitals to `error`.
4. **Do we have field data?** (a PSI API key + enough traffic for CrUX) → recommend adding `PSI_API_KEY` as a repo secret; if traffic is thin, CrUX will be `NONE` — lean on lab + your own RUM until it fills.
5. **Wire RUM now?** (web-vitals in the app → which sink: your `/rum` endpoint, GA4, etc.) → recommend yes only if a sink exists; otherwise defer and note it.
6. **Where do results land?** (`temporary-public-storage` PR link vs a self-hosted LHCI server) → recommend `temporary-public-storage` to start.

## Setup workflow

Run once the interview settles. Reuse the shipped `templates/` and `scripts/` — copy and adapt, don't hand-roll:

1. **Detect the stack + run mode** (step 2 above). Confirm the build command and the served URL/dir.
2. **Write `lighthouserc.json`** at repo root from `templates/lighthouserc.json`; set the `collect` block to the detected run mode and keep the Core Web Vitals assertions. Full option map: `reference/lighthouse-ci.md`.
3. **Write the lab workflow** `.github/workflows/lighthouse-ci.yml` from `templates/lighthouse-ci.yml` (checkout → setup-node → `npm ci` → build if present → `npx @lhci/cli autorun`).
4. **Wire the field check** (Lab + Field): copy `scripts/runCrux.mjs` (the durable field source) to `.github/perf/` and add `.github/workflows/field-check.yml` from the template (runs on successful `deployment_status` + weekly cron). Add a `PSI_API_KEY` secret — a Google key with **both** the PageSpeed Insights API and the **Chrome UX Report API** enabled. It reads `templates/budgets.json` and **exits non-zero** when a real-user Core Web Vital is `poor`; "no CrUX record" (low traffic) passes. Also copy `runPagespeed.mjs` if you want an on-demand lab check via PSI.
5. **(Optional) RUM** — copy `templates/web-vitals.js` into the app entry, point `ENDPOINT` at the sink, `npm i web-vitals`. It uses the **attribution** build so a bad score names its cause. Details: `reference/web-vitals-rum.md`.
6. **Verify** — locally: `npx @lhci/cli autorun` against a build, and `node scripts/runPagespeed.mjs https://your-url --strategy=mobile` with a key. Show the before/after and the exact files written; get approval before committing.

## Canonical lab budget (`lighthouserc.json`)

```json
{
  "ci": {
    "collect": { "staticDistDir": "./dist", "numberOfRuns": 3 },
    "assert": {
      "preset": "lighthouse:recommended",
      "assertions": {
        "categories:performance": ["error", { "minScore": 0.9 }],
        "largest-contentful-paint": ["error", { "maxNumericValue": 2500 }],
        "cumulative-layout-shift": ["error", { "maxNumericValue": 0.1 }],
        "total-blocking-time": ["error", { "maxNumericValue": 200 }],
        "first-contentful-paint": ["warn", { "maxNumericValue": 1800 }],
        "server-response-time": ["warn", { "maxNumericValue": 800 }]
      }
    },
    "upload": { "target": "temporary-public-storage" }
  }
}
```

Swap `collect` for the run mode: `{ "startServerCommand": "npm run start", "url": ["http://localhost:3000/"] }` or `{ "url": ["https://preview.example.com/"] }`. `total-blocking-time` is the lab stand-in for INP.

## Field check (Chrome UX Report API)

Real-user field data comes from the **CrUX API** — the durable source, since PSI is dropping its CrUX (`loadingExperience`) data. PSI stays useful for the **lab** score.

```bash
# real-user Core Web Vitals (p75) — exits 1 on a "poor" vital, passes if no CrUX record
node scripts/runCrux.mjs https://example.com --form-factor=PHONE --key=$PSI_API_KEY
# lab score (+ legacy PSI field data while it lasts)
node scripts/runPagespeed.mjs https://example.com --strategy=mobile --key=$PSI_API_KEY
```

`runCrux.mjs` reads each vital's 75th percentile, falls back from the exact URL to the origin, and treats "no CrUX record" (low traffic) as a pass. Endpoints + response shapes: `reference/crux-api.md` (field), `reference/pagespeed-insights.md` (lab).

## Honest scope — what we do NOT wire

- **`mod_pagespeed` / ngx_pagespeed (PageSpeed Module)** — Google archived it (~2021). Do optimization at **build time** (bundler, image pipeline) and at the **CDN edge** instead. Name it, don't install it.
- **Google Hosted Libraries CDN** — browser cache partitioning (~2020) erased the shared-cache win; **self-host/bundle** is faster now (one less third-party DNS+TLS hop).
- **Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8)** — a client-side resolver choice, not a CI gate; the real TTFB lever is a fast CDN/DNS for your own domain.
