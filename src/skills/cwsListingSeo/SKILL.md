# Chrome Web Store listing SEO (+ GEO)

Maximize **discovery and conversion** for a Chrome extension listing without keyword spam. Work in two surfaces:

| Surface | Goal | Primary levers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CWS listing** | Store search + category + Featured path | Name, summary, Overview, category, assets, ratings, retention |
| **Marketing site / docs** | Google Search + AI Overviews / AI Mode | Helpful unique content, crawlability, Search Console |

Official ranking signals (CWS): **relevancy (name + description)**, **popularity (rating count + average)**, **quality/UX**, and **usage** (e.g. installs vs uninstalls). See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

## Automated vs manual (do not fake APIs)

### Prefer automate (scripts / free Google APIs)

| Task | How |
| --- | --- |
| Character limits + spam heuristics | `node scripts/validateListingCopy.mjs` |
| Name ≤75, summary ≤132, description ≤16k | same script |
| Superlatives / brand-dump / >5 keyword repeats | same script (policy heuristics) |
| Marketing-site lab performance | PageSpeed Insights API / Lighthouse (`web-perf-ci` skill) |
| Site query + AI Overview visibility | Search Console UI / Search Console API (after verify) |
| Demand language (web, not CWS) | Google Trends UI / Trends API alpha; Keyword Planner (Ads) |

### Must stay manual or agent-browser research

| Task | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **CWS keyword volume** | No official free CWS keyword API |
| CWS autocomplete + top-10 competitor titles/summaries | Store is JS-heavy; agent/browser research is the reliable path |
| Judging natural language vs stuffing | Policy is qualitative |
| Featured badge readiness | Human product/UX bar, not copy-only |
| Authentic ratings / retention | Product + support, not metadata hacks |
| GEO “mentions” / `llms.txt` magic | Google: ignore for Search; still classic SEO |

There is **no official free Google API that ranks or keyword-volumes the Chrome Web Store**. Do not invent one.

## Workflow

1. **Load sources of truth** for the extension
   - Title: `STORE_TITLE` / manifest `name` / listing name field
   - Summary: package short description / manifest description (≤132)
   - Overview: `cws-listing.ts` `listing.description` (or dashboard long description)
   - Homepage URL, category, screenshots/icons
2. **Research seeds (manual / browser)** — 5–15 problem phrases users would type in the store (`bulk prompts`, `chatgpt queue`, …). For each seed, capture autocomplete + top titles/summaries. Cluster into primary job + platforms + jobs-to-be-done.
3. **Draft copy**
   - **Name (≤75):** `[Brand] – [primary job in plain language]` — no stuffing
   - **Summary (≤132):** value-first; primary job + 1–2 platforms/outcomes
   - **Overview (≤16k):** overview paragraph → feature sections → audience → trust/privacy. Keywords **in sentences**, never brand/location lists
4. **Validate**

   ```bash
   node scripts/validateListingCopy.mjs \
     --name "…" --summary "…" --description-file ./overview.txt
   # or JSON:
   node scripts/validateListingCopy.mjs --json-file ./listing-copy.json
   ```

5. **Apply** to the repo SSOT (`cws-listing.ts`, `STORE_TITLE`, package `description`). Do **not** push to CWS unless the user asks.
6. **GEO (owned site only)** — unique how-to / workflow content, FAQ in human language, PSI/Lighthouse health, Search Console Generative AI report. Skip `llms.txt` as a ranking strategy for Google.
7. **Report** before/after + policy checklist + which steps were automated vs researched.

## Hard policy red lines (Chrome)

From CWS **Keyword Spam** / listing requirements:

- No irrelevant or excessive keywords
- No bare lists of sites / brands / keywords without value
- No lists of regional locations
- No unnatural repetition of the **same** keyword more than **5** times
- No unattributed testimonials in the description
- No superlatives like “best/greatest/fastest” in the summary (official listing guide)

When unsure, cut keywords — suspension risk beats rank fantasy.

## Field checklist

- [ ] Name ≤75, clear, unique, not stuffed
- [ ] Summary ≤132, front-loads value, no competitor names
- [ ] Overview: paragraph + scannable sections; keywords contextual
- [ ] `validateListingCopy.mjs` exits 0 (or warnings accepted consciously)
- [ ] Category accurate
- [ ] Screenshots/icons match current product
- [ ] Homepage + support URLs real
- [ ] Marketing site (if any): GSC verified; PSI checked
- [ ] No CWS push as a side effect of unrelated work
