name: deslop
description: Reviews code readability first, then applies approved cleanup that makes the full pipeline understandable in seconds. Use when the user says "deslop", "make this readable", "make this less AI", "second pass", "clean this up", "rename for clarity", "show before and after", or asks to improve code comprehension across React, TypeScript, backend, folders, imports, hooks, or functions.

# Deslop

Make code feel deliberate and easy to understand quickly. The default mode is review-first: show the user the current pipeline, the proposed style, and concrete before/after examples before changing files.

Do not apply edits until the user approves the style, unless the user explicitly says to apply immediately.

> **Companion skill:** `deslop` makes code *readable* (naming, ordering, splitting for clarity); `deslop-v2` makes it *lean* (removing over-engineering — pass-through wrappers, `??` confetti, nested ternaries, grab-bag returns, and over-nested folders/packages). If the real problem is too much abstraction or structure rather than unclear naming, use `deslop-v2`. When both apply, deslop-v2 removes the excess first, then deslop names what remains.

## Core Contract

Optimize for a developer understanding the important path in about 5 seconds:

```txt
entrypoint -> data/load step -> transformation -> side effect -> UI/output
```

Good deslop work may rename symbols, reorder imports, move files, split or inline functions, extract React hooks, remove pointless hooks, rename folders, flatten render branches, or simplify module boundaries. The measure is readability of the pipeline, not blindly adding abstractions.

## Style source (read first)

Before proposing any style, read the repo's own style guide if it exists: `CODE-STYLE.md` (the SSOT) and the `## Conventions` digest in `AGENTS.md`. When present, they are the **authoritative target style** for this repo — the generic doctrine below only fills the gaps they don't cover, and where the two conflict, **CODE-STYLE.md wins**. Code that breaks its Rules or hits its "Never" list is a primary deslop target, called out first.

You **enforce** the guide; you never edit it. If one of its rules looks wrong or is fighting readability, flag it in the review and point the user to `grill-me-code-style-with-docs` to evolve the guide — don't silently deviate from it. If neither file exists, proceed on the generic doctrine below exactly as before.

## Review First

1. Identify the target files from the user's paths, `git diff`, recent session edits, or the nearest entrypoint.
2. Read the relevant files before judging them.
3. Map the current pipeline with concrete file and symbol names.
4. Find comprehension blockers:
   - names that hide behavior or return shape
   - functions/components/hooks doing several jobs
   - imports, folders, or file names that hide ownership
   - data shaping mixed with side effects
   - React render logic with nested branches or noisy derived values
   - too many tiny helpers that obscure the main flow
5. Show 2-4 before/after examples representing the proposed style.
6. Ask for approval before editing.

Use [references/review-and-apply.md](references/review-and-apply.md) for the exact report and edit rules.

## Review Output Shape

Keep the review compact and concrete:

```txt
Current 5-second map
FileA -> vagueFn -> useThing -> handler -> render

Proposed map
ThingPage -> useThingPageData -> buildThingViewModel -> ThingContent
```

Then include:

- `Main readability issue:` one sentence
- `Before/after examples:` short code snippets, not a giant diff
- `Risk:` API/import/test impact
- `Apply?` ask whether to apply this style now

## Apply After Approval

When approved:

1. Edit only the approved scope.
2. Preserve behavior unless the user explicitly approved behavior changes.
3. Prefer the smallest change that makes the pipeline clearer.
4. Rename public exports, routes, folders, or shared APIs only after mapping their usages.
5. Run the relevant typecheck/test/lint gate when available.
6. Summarize the actual before -> after pipeline.

## Examples

Use [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) when the user wants explicit examples or when the review would otherwise be too abstract.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask before editing when:

- the cleanup requires a behavioral decision
- a rename crosses public API or package boundaries
- the real fix is architectural, not readability cleanup
- tests are missing and the change is broad
- the current code is already clear enough
