description: Use when the user runs /fix-bug, says "fix this bug", "fix these bugs", "reproduce then fix", "debug this failure", or describes one or more concrete defects and wants senior-engineer proof (env, logs, edge cases, verification) before code changes — never patch from the report alone.

# Fix Bug

Treat the user's report as a **hypothesis**, not a patch list. Work one defect at a time (or a small independent set) through reproduce → root cause → fix → verify. Do not edit product code for a defect until that defect is observed, or reproduction is blocked with evidence you report honestly.

## Safety

- Read repository run, test, seed, and environment instructions before starting services or mutating data.
- Prefer local, sandbox, or explicitly authorized environments. Do not use production write paths, real customer data, or live payments to prove a bug unless the user authorizes it and no safer path exists.
- Never expose secrets, tokens, PII, or private logs in the final report. Redact when quoting evidence.
- Stop and ask when reproduction needs credentials, irreversible actions, or product choices you cannot discover safely. Do not invent a root cause to unblock coding.
- Prefer the smallest correct fix. No drive-by refactors, unrelated cleanups, or "while I'm here" scope expansion unless required to land the fix.

## Multi-bug queue

When the user describes **more than one** bug (or a batch):

1. Inventory each item as a short ticket: ID (bug-1…), symptoms, expected vs actual, severity/impact, known steps, and shared vs independent surface.
2. Order the queue: blockers and crashes first, then user-visible wrong behavior, then polish. Prefer fixing shared root causes once when evidence shows one cause feeds many tickets.
3. Run the full workflow **per ticket** (or per shared root-cause group). Do not claim the batch is done while any ticket is unreproduced, unfixed, or unverified.
4. Keep a live scoreboard: `open | reproducing | root-caused | fixed | verified | blocked`. Update it after each ticket.
5. If tickets interact, re-verify earlier verified tickets after later fixes when shared code changed.

Single-bug runs are just a queue of length 1.

## Workflow

For **each** ticket in order:

### 1. Capture (do not code yet)

- Restate symptoms, expected vs actual, environment hints, and any steps the user gave.
- List what would count as a successful reproduction and a successful fix for this ticket only.
- Treat "I think it's in file X" as a lead, not as the diagnosis.

### 2. Reproduce like a senior engineer

- Boot what the stack needs: install deps, start services, seed data, feature flags, mobile/web targets, or the minimal CLI path.
- Prefer the highest-signal path available, in order:
  1. failing automated test or a new minimal failing test that encodes the report;
  2. scripted CLI/API path with logs;
  3. real UI/app path with console/network/device logs when the bug is user-visible.
- Collect evidence: stack traces, log lines, status codes, screenshots, DB/query results, race timing notes. Save commands so verification can re-run them.
- Probe nearby edge cases that could change the diagnosis (empty input, auth boundary, concurrency, locale, offline, large payload, first-run vs returning).
- **Gate:** no product-code fix until the bug is observed **or** you document a blocked reproduction (missing env, flaky only in prod, insufficient access) and get direction.

### 3. Root cause

- Trace from observed failure to the responsible code path with evidence (not "maybe").
- Separate: trigger, underlying defect, and any secondary symptoms.
- If multiple tickets share one cause, merge them for fix/verify and note which IDs close together.
- If the report is wrong or incomplete, say so with evidence and update the ticket before coding.

### 4. Fix

- Implement the minimal change that addresses the root cause.
- Add or extend a regression test when the stack makes that practical; otherwise record an explicit manual repro command as the regression harness.
- Keep unrelated files out of the diff.

### 5. Verify

- Re-run the **same** reproduction path; it must pass.
- Re-check the edge cases that matter for this ticket.
- Run the repository's relevant narrow tests and the project verify gate when the change is non-trivial.
- For multi-bug: mark the ticket `verified`, then proceed to the next open ticket. Re-smoke shared surfaces when a later fix touches the same code.

## Verification

Report a per-ticket table (or equivalent sections) covering:

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Ticket | ID + one-line symptom |
| Repro | Commands/steps, env identity, evidence observed before the fix |
| Root cause | Evidence-backed explanation (file/function when known) |
| Fix | What changed and why it addresses the cause |
| Proof | Same repro after fix, tests run, edge cases checked |
| Status | verified / blocked / deferred with reason |
| Residual risk | What was not covered |

Do **not** claim a bug (or the batch) is fixed if you only read the report and edited code without observing the failure and re-running the repro path. Do not collapse multiple tickets into one green claim without per-ticket proof.
